# pain-alpha-dynamics

This repository contains the code and analyses for Dryden Arseneau's M.Sc. thesis at Western University, examining whether the balance of slow versus fast alpha oscilaltions predicts individual differences in pain perception.

## Project Summary
*To be finalized after first committee meeting.*

Briefly:
This project investigates the relationship between parietal alpha dynamics and perceived pain intensity using EEG data collectedacross multiple cap configurations (32-, 62-, and 64-channel). Analyses will employ generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to characterize potential nonlinear relationships between alpha frequency, power, and pain ratings.

## Environment
Dependencies and environment specifications will be listed once the analysis pipeline is finalized

---

## Citation
*To be added upon thesis submission / publication.*
